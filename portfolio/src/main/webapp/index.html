        <p class="bioDescription">
          Hello there! I am a rising junior studying Computer Science 
          and Business at Oregon State University. Outside of the classroom, I enjoy
          being part of TALI, a group of undergraduate students interested in teaching
          K-12 students about STEM and Computer Science. Learning about 
          Computer Science early on allows students to develop strong problem-solving 
          skills which can be applied to their education and beyond. In the future, I hope to
          continue engaging students in technology at a young age. In my free time, 
          I enjoy hiking, exploring Oregon, and planning new adventures.

          <h2>ABROAD</h2>
          <p class="abroadDescription">
            After high school, I received a scholarship to participate in a
            year-long program in Germany where I had the opportunity to live
            with a host-family, participate in hands-on internships, and learn
            German. My experiences in Germany increased my interest in travel
            and language learning, which motivated me to study abroad during college.
            Last summer, I studied abroad at Yonsei University in Seoul, South Korea.
            Thanks to the Benjamin A. Gilman International and Critical Language 
            Scholarships, I was able to take courses related to my major and study
            Korean. My most memorable experiences included participating in Taekwondo
            after school, making life-long friendships, and learning to navigate the
            public transportation system in a new country. Thanks to these experiences,
            I have gained a lifetime of memories and a unique global perspective.
